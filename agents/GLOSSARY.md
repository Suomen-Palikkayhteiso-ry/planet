# Glossary & Vocabulary Canon

This document defines the canonical terminology for the Planet project to ensure clarity and reduce semantic drift, especially for LLM agents.

## Core Concepts

- **Planet**: The final, aggregated HTML page generated by the application. It represents a "planet" of content from various "stars" (feeds).
- **Feed**: A single source of content, typically an RSS, Atom, or similar XML feed.
- **Item**: A single entry within a feed, such as a blog post, a YouTube video, or a Flickr photo.
- **Self-Contained**: A core architectural principle. The generated HTML file must contain all necessary CSS and JS, requiring no external file requests to render correctly.

## Configuration (`planet.toml`)

- **`title`**: The main title of the generated Planet HTML page.
- **`locale`**: The language setting (e.g., "en", "fi") used for internationalization, affecting date formats and UI labels.
- **`timezone`**: The IANA timezone name (e.g., "Europe/Helsinki") used to correctly display all dates and times relative to a specific region.
- **`feeds`**: The list of all content sources to be aggregated.
- **`feed.type`**: The category of the feed, which controls its presentation. Canonical types:
  - `blog`: A standard RSS/Atom feed for a blog.
  - `youtube`: A feed for a YouTube channel.
  - `flickr`: A feed for a Flickr photo stream.

## Implementation

- **`blaze-html`**: The Haskell DSL used for generating type-safe HTML.
- **`htoml-megaparsec`**: The library used for parsing the `planet.toml` configuration file.
- **`feed`**: The library for parsing generic RSS/Atom feed data.

## Deprecated/Ambiguous Terms

- **Post/Article/Video**: Use **Item** to refer to a single piece of content from any source.
- **Generator**: Use **Application** or **`planet` CLI** to refer to the program itself.
- **Website/Site**: Use **Planet** to refer to the generated `index.html` file.
