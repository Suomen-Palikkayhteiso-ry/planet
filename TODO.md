# TODO

Complete as many [ ] task items as possible. After completing each task, test, commit, and push your changes. Mark each completed task as [x] in this TODO.md, including the commit hash in parentheses. If a task is too large to complete at once, create additional TODO files starting with "TODO-" and reference them from this file. Do not commit any TODO files.

Follow the guidelines in AGENTS.md and especially ADR-0000. Do not create any user- or developer-facing documentation. You may maintain documentation for LLM agents by keeping AGENTS.md up to date, concise, and primarily referencing more detailed documentation in ./agents or ./agents/adrs (for Architecture Decision Records).

## Tasks

This project as been Haskell-only script to generate static HTML aggregation of RSS feeds. Now we need more rich user interface. We chose elm-lang as the front-end lanuage. The end result should be elm-lang SPA wit statically generated data for the the app. The app will show data from statically generated elm-module. The current Haskell program must be refactored to genererate that elm-lang module of data instead of the current static HTML. The elm-app should use tailwindcss for its styling. Especially we must not generate intermediat JSON data for the elm app to parse, because we are not allowed to redistributed the aggregated data.

* [x] Append this TODO.md with tasks to complete test coverage for the current Haskell app. (f44c1c9)
* [x] Review `test/` directory to understand existing Haskell test structure and coverage. (f44c1c9)
* [x] Identify areas in `src/` (e.g., `Config.hs`, `FeedParser.hs`, `HtmlGen.hs`, `I18n.hs`, `Planet.hs`) with insufficient test coverage. (f44c1c9)
* [x] For each identified area, write new tests in the appropriate `test/` module to cover missing functionality or edge cases. (f44c1c9)
* [x] Ensure new tests adhere to existing testing conventions and styles (e.g., using `Hspec` and `QuickCheck` if prevalent). (f44c1c9)
* [x] Update test suite entry points (e.g., `test/Spec.hs`, `test/TestSuite.hs`) if necessary to include new test modules. (f44c1c9)

* [x] Update devenv.nix to support the required elm-lang (and possibly node / vite) development environment required for this project. (f44c1c9)

* [x] Append this TODO.md Tasks with required intermedia task to reach, lint, test and develop further the app as defined. (f44c1c9)
* [x] Initialize an Elm project (e.g., using `elm init` via `elm-land init`).
* [x] Integrate TailwindCSS into the Elm project.
* [ ] Define Elm types and functions to consume the data generated by the Haskell app. (in_progress - types defined, functions await Haskell refactor)
* [ ] Develop the Elm UI (main view, components).
* [ ] Implement Elm testing.
* [ ] Implement Elm linting (e.g., `elm-review`, `elm-format`).
* [ ] Implement the Haskell side to generate the Elm data module. (in_progress - see subtasks)

* [x] Append this TODO.md Tasks with required intermedia tasks to ensure ADR-0000 conformance. (f44c1c9)
* [ ] Identify missing or outdated user stories under ./agents/stories
* [ ] Map existing tests to user stories and ADRs
* [ ] Add references in test headers to US and ADR IDs
* [ ] Review ADRs for missing constraints or outdated decisions
* [ ] Convert suitable high-level tests to BDD scenarios
* [ ] Simplify or refactor over-abstracted BDD steps
* [ ] Add tests where acceptance criteria are not executable
* [ ] Flag conflicts between tests, stories, and ADRs
* [ ] Propose new ADRs where architectural intent is implicit
